- [HF commissioning](#HFcommissioning)

<a name="RA2b">
## *RA2/b* 

To do list :

1. Make patch for whatever went wrong with the L2L3 residuals
2. Edit RA2/b section of the DPS note

<a name="HFcommissioning">
## *HF frontend commissioning* 

To do list:

1. Thinks about availability of hardware for installing a crate into UXC
2. Verify that triggered readout works with the RCMS configuration files
	+ need to make sure that crate 50 gets added to the run configuration so that the DAQ is automatically configured
	+ figure out how to analyze the data 
	+ test ICI functionality
3. Test ngRBXmanager at 904
4. Get LV power software running at 904 for HF crates
	+ figure out where the ngCCMs are and get UMD guys to test them (and the backplanes maybe)
5. Figure out database issues for ePortage
