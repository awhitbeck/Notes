## *Summary*

Working on 1 main project today:

<a name="RA2b">
## *RA2/b* 

To do list :

1. Make patch for whatever went wrong with the L2L3 residuals
2. Announce the files once they are done
3. Make new plots for the DPS -- update plots by Monday morning for the DPS
4. Edit RA2/b section of the DPS note... I think its in rough shape
